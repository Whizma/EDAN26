 * i.e., with [size] but for convenience most people refer to the data
 * in memory as an array here despite the graph_t's v and e members
 * are not strictly arrays. they are pointers. once we have allocated

 * using an array or pointer is the same so we can refer to a node with
 *
 * 			g->v[i]
 *
 * where the -> is identical to Java's . in this expression.
 *
 * in summary: just use the v and e as arrays.
 *
 * a difference between C and Java is that in Java you can really not
 * have an array of nodes as we do. instead you need to have an array
 * of node references. in C we can have both arrays and local variables
 * with structs that are not allocated as with Java's new but instead
 * as any basic type such as int.
